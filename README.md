🌱 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) — a systematic method for evaluating the environmental impacts associated with every stage of a product’s life cycle.
From raw material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, to end-of-life disposal, LCA helps identify critical areas where improvements can reduce negative environmental impact.

Our goal is to create a data-driven LCA platform that simplifies analysis, improves data reliability, and helps decision-makers make sustainable choices.

🎯 Objectives

Identify key environmental impact categories (carbon footprint, water usage, energy consumption).

Address data quality issues and ensure robust, reliable results.

Provide a user-friendly way to communicate results to decision-makers.

Enable scenario comparison (e.g., alternative materials, processes).

🛠️ Technical Approach

Data Collection & Cleaning: Gather data from trusted sources, handle missing/poor-quality data.

System Boundary Definition: Clearly define scope (Cradle-to-Gate, Cradle-to-Grave, etc.).

Impact Assessment: Use standardized methods (e.g., ISO 14040/14044).

Visualization: Create clear, intuitive dashboards and charts for stakeholders.

✅ Feasibility & Viability

Feasibility:

Open-source datasets and tools available.

Scalable solution that can handle multiple products/processes.

Viability:

Helps companies comply with sustainability regulations.

Supports ESG reporting and carbon neutrality goals.

🌍 Impact & Benefits

Environmental Impact: Reduce carbon footprint and resource usage by identifying hotspots.

Economic Benefit: Optimize production processes and save costs.

Decision Support: Make sustainability metrics accessible and understandable for businesses.

📖 Example Use Case

Product: Plastic Water Bottle

Step 1: Define system boundary (Cradle-to-Grave).

Step 2: Collect data for raw material extraction, production, transportation, and recycling.

Step 3: Analyze emissions and resource consumption.

Step 4: Compare with alternative (e.g., aluminum bottle).

Result: Identify which option is environmentally preferable.
